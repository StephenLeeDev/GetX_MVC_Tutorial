# getx_mvc_tutorial

I've recently been assigned to a project implemented using the MVC design pattern with GetX. But I am not familiar with GetX and the MVC design pattern. Therefore, this repository is created for the purpose of learning GetX and the MVC design pattern to fulfill my responsibilities for the assigned project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
